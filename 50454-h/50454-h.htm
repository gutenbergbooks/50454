<p class='pindent'>Dr. Rand was a man of rare genius and high attainments. It
would be a wrong to him, to the country, and to the Church of
Christ to allow his name to pass into oblivion. I am grateful to Mr.
Clark for his highly creditable effort to do some justice to the
character and work of a truly good, devoted, brilliant and scholarly
Christian man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My own acquaintance with Silas Tertius Rand extended over a
period of more than thirty years. He attracted my attention and
admiration when I came to this city long ago, an eager student of
books and men. Rand was then in his early prime, tall, erect,
lithe; never well-dressed; always notable. His features were regular;
his forehead was lofty; his eyes were steel-grey and keen, and
his look very kindly. He had abundance of dark wavy hair.
While speaking, his gestures were perfectly natural and graceful.
He had a melodious voice, clear, easily modulated to any key, and
easily reaching any audience. His sentences were rhythmic, and
rose and fell on the delighted ear with fitting cadence. He was a
born orator, though utterly unconscious of the fact. Indeed his
unconsciousness was one of the charms of his praying, his preaching
and his speaking. His mind was full of his subject and in complete
sympathy with his audience, whom he usually held spell-bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never thought of Dr. Rand as growing old, though the last
time he spent half an hour with me his locks were thin and grey,
his eyes were dim, his forehead deeply furrowed, and his speech
less clear than of old, because the “grinders were few,” and he had
reached or passed beyond his fourscore years. He was wont to tell
of his work among the Indians and for them, and it was my pleasant
duty to repeat the story as best I could to my readers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a poet; and he was wont to honor me with the perusal
of his poems, Latin as well as English, before they were in type;
and I liked them well, and like them still. His Latin translations
show marvellous aptitude and resource. Some are worthy of the
poet-saints of the Middle Ages who breathed their fears, their faith,
and their sorrows into lyrics that cannot die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His life-work was to master the Micmac language, to find his
way to the hearts of the poor children of the forest, and to tell them
the story of the Gospel in its simplicity. He made the language his
own; he gathered the traditions of the Indians and learned their
ways; and in many instances found his way to their hearts. He
not only translated portions of the New Testament and Psalms into
Micmac, but prepared a complete vocabulary of the language. This
work and his Bible translations are in print, and may yet be found
useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to his success as a missionary among the Indians, it is not
for me to speak. This I may say: Dr. Rand was wont to go among
the Indians from camp to camp, telling them the story of redeeming
love and pointing them to the “Lamb of God.” He had won the
confidence of many. He had access to their minds and hearts, and
he was fully convinced that not a few had become sincere Christians.
He did not ask them to sever their connection with the Church of
Rome; he asked them simply to follow Christ. One brilliant convert
he had—a very able man, Ben Christmas. But strong drink ruined
this poor Indian so far as this life was concerned. I believe he died
a humble penitent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Micmac Mission is now seemingly forgotten. It was never
well organized, never adequately supported. Can it be revived?
Where is Dr. Rand’s successor? Should the Lord call any of our
young earnest and devoted Baptist brethren to this work the new
missionary ought to have at his back the whole influence, the spiritual
and material resources, of the denomination. The work could now
be conducted much more advantageously than when Dr. Rand
grappled with it. I am sure the Christian community would hail
with pleasure a revival of the Indian wigwam enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I may add that Dr. Rand was one of the few men I have known
who seemed to be on terms of reverential intimacy with the blessed
Lord and Master of us all. When praying he knew and felt that
the Lord was listening. To him there was reality in all acts of
worship, and he helped others to realize the presence of God.
There was no hard, high, dead wall between him and the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit. As he advanced in years he dropped the censoriousness
in which he sometimes indulged in earlier years. A
man like Dr. Rand is a gift from God, for which any community
ought to be grateful; and the remembrance of him ought to be
lovingly cherished.</p>

<div><h1 id='pageXI'><span class='sc'>foreword.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>This little book brings again into the sunlight some few records
of the life and work of a very remarkable man. It seems fitting at
this time to present in a popular form a glance at the life and work
of Dr. Rand, as it will be fifty years on the twelfth of next November,
since the work was organized, and Silas T. Rand appointed by
the Commissioners at Halifax to his chosen field of labour among
the Micmacs of the Maritime Provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the victories and defeats connected with this mission in
which our fathers shared (or might have shared) have been forgotten;
and, as we now gather what there is for us of encouragement and
enjoyment in the records of that noble undertaking, we cannot but
find stimulation and satisfaction in living over again, however
imperfectly, the struggles and triumphs of one of our own heroes,—one
who is certainly worthy of our highest appreciation. Only a
small part of the available material will be used, as nobody is prepared
to write a biography at present; and, even if someone could
spend months among the Rand Manuscripts in the Libraries at
Wellesley and Acadia, the occasion that calls this forth would have
passed away before the work could be ready for the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This booklet does not pretend to be a biography; you may call
it a Memorial, or even a Jubilee Souvenir, if you wish; but, kindly
do not overlook the purpose for which it is issued:—In all seriousness
allow it to call your attention to the stern fact that the Micmac
Mission, while in progress was very much hindered by lack of
Christian sympathy, and, since the faithful laborer was removed to
his reward, no attempt has been made to carry on the work which
was so manfully undertaken fifty years ago. And then, with these
considerations, and the parting words of our Best Friend, fresh in
your memory, ask yourself whether we to-day are any longer justified
in repeating Cain’s impertinent question, or answering it in his own
self-complacent way. Surely we know a better way to keep the
jubilee of Dr. Rand’s splendid endeavour than either altogether to
ignore the man and his work, or merely to feast our fancy upon the
beautiful mythology of the Micmacs which he has given us as one of
the incidents of his work. It is ours to build, if we will, on the
broad foundation which he has laid; shall we not take advantage of
this opportunity, and to do our share towards giving the people life.
Let us realize the fact that until Silas T. Rand aroused our people
fifty years ago, no Christian teaching had been attempted among the
Micmacs except by Roman Catholic missionaries; and it is not enough
that they had <span class='it'>modified the mythology</span> of the Micmacs,—in no other
terms could the work be described which had been done before Dr.
Rand began his campaign based upon an open Bible for every man,
and a full and free salvation procured for us all through the atonement
made by Jesus Christ. The Roman Catholic missionaries are
to be honoured for their self-sacrificing work,—Dr. Rand and his
supporters are to be highly honoured for their splendid endeavour,—but,
while we honour those who so richly deserve this tardy tribute
from us, let us remember that our duty to our fellowmen is not done
by simply making additions to our stock of heroes and hero-worship.
The hero is, after all, the conscientious toiler; he makes mistakes
like other men; he may even err to a greater degree because he lives
at higher pressure, but he is filled with his mission, and, whether he
“succeed” or not, no moment of his life is lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Dr. Rand had with great difficulty learned the Micmac
language, and reduced it to written form, he translated for the people
the New Testament, and Genesis, and the Psalms; and as he went
about his work day by day, he kept adding to his literary labours,
until he had at last completed a Grammar and a Dictionary, the latter
of which is now published by the Canadian Government. He
tramped ceaselessly from settlement to settlement, sharing to the
fullest extent the wretchedness of the degenerate descendants of that
once lordly race, as he laboured to make the Gospel Message plain to
the sons of the forest. He met discouragement in every form; he
received scant sympathy from his fellow-Christians, every step he
took was most bitterly opposed by the Roman Catholic clergy, but he
lived to rejoice in the work that brought fulness of life to a number
of the people, and laid a broad foundation for future work, before
he answered the summons that called him home to his reward.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>T has been the writer’s privilege to gain possession of Dr. Rand’s
private diary, through the kindness of his daughter Hattie;
and, after a great deal of labour, the rare privilege is ours of being
able to see the struggles and successes of this great undertaking
from the standpoint of the one upon whose shoulders the full weight
of the burden always pressed,—the one, too, who had the first and
fullest share in the rewards that ever follow faithful service for
mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diary was hastily written—often with a poor pen and poorer
ink, besides other inconveniences, as he moved from place to place,
carrying on the work of the Mission, but the difficulties one meets in
reading the volumes are banished by the pleasure of learning, as
fully as may be, the details and the leading events in that remarkable
work. But there are difficulties which are not at all due to the
condition of the manuscript; and the student, if he be in any way
ambitious to test his powers as a linguist, is here presented with perhaps
the best opportunity that man ever had,—for here are whole
volumes written in Latin and French, with pages of Micmac and
Maliseet, and Greek, interspersed amongst the more solid matter;
while Hebrew words occur occasionally, and prove very “shibboleths”
to one who has become assured that the Maritime Provinces,
like <span class='it'>Omnia Gallia</span>, are still divided into three parts. There are,
perhaps a thousand pages written in Pitman’s method of shorthand,
and Dr. Rand also used and published in a phonetic method which
necessitated the mastery of another alphabet of which the translator
may have no further use after the present undertaking is completed.
Writing in his Diary on March 16th, 1884, he tells how he had been
for two weeks reading a copy of the Scriptures in Eskimo, kindly
loaned by Dr. Sawyer, of Acadia; and that portion of his Diary
written while on his tour through what was then called “Western
Canada,” abounds with Indian words used by the different tribes in
that section. There are complete lists of the first decade of numerals
in the languages of the Mohawks, Onedias, Senecas, Ceyugas,
Onondagas, and Tuscaroros, and such words as “bread,” “milk,”
etc., are traced through all the different dialects. Nor was Dr.
Rand satisfied with gathering what he could from the languages used
in the schools and forests of Canada; he became more or less familiar
with German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese; and, to cap the
climax, the page of the Diary which relates a conversation with a
returned Burman Missionary is adorned with a number of Burmese
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we realize the marvellous progress he made as a linguist,
we can, only after an effort, believe the well authenticated statement
that this man was a plain farmer and stone-mason, with a most
meagre education, when, at twenty-three years of age, he presented
himself at the Academy in connection with Acadia College, at Wolfville,
Nova Scotia. To him, “learning” had never been a task,
and he seized upon each opportunity with all the enthusiasm of his
buoyant nature. He says:—“My first lesson in Latin was taken
the first night of the four weeks I spent in Horton Academy. I
heard a fellow-student, the late Wellington Jackson, repeat over and
over again: ‘The words <span class='it'>opus</span> and <span class='it'>usus</span> signifying “need,” require
the ablative, as, <span class='it'>Est opus pecunia</span>, “There is need of money.” ’ That
rule, and the truth it contained, was so impressed upon my memory,
and was such a perfect illustration of my own circumstances that I
never forgot it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His stay at the Academy was brief, but he had made good use
of his opportunities, and from that time on he was, in the fullest
sense of the word, a student. He says that in the spring of 1833 he
returned to the work of a stone-mason and the study of Latin. In
the following year his ability as a student and a Christian teacher
was recognized, and responding to the urgent call for such men, he
laid down his trowel to be ordained and chosen pastor of the Baptist
Church at Parrsboro. From this time on, besides continuing his
Latin studies, he began to work on Greek and Hebrew in order that
he might be better able to understand and teach the Sacred Scriptures.
After two years in the pastorate, he again studied at Acadia
for a time, but as Pegasus may boldly deviate from the common
track, so we find the young man, Silas Rand, in his literary studies
following the light of his own erratic genius, as he laboured on for
ten years in the regular work of the ministry. During these years
he was pastor successively at Horton, Liverpool, Windsor, and
Charlottetown; and in Charlottetown he began his work as the missionary
to the Micmacs. It was while pastor at Liverpool, on the
10th of May, 1838, that he was united to the companion of his life,
Jane McNutt, whose home was at that place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The year 1846 may well be remembered as one of great missionary
interest in the Maritime Provinces. Christian men and women
began to realize that a larger privilege and responsibility was theirs
than they before had dreamed of. That year Maritime Presbyterians
became represented abroad by John Geddie and Isaac Archibald in
the South Sea Islands, and Maritime Baptists sent Mr. and Mrs.
Burpee to Burma. During the year Professor Isaac Chipman, of
Acadia, suggested to Mr. Rand that, as there were heathen in our
own country, he, who had made such rapid progress in learning
languages, should learn the Indian language, and give the Gospel to
them. As he looks back to that occasion, the Micmac Missionary
says: “I took hold of the idea, and determined thenceforth to devote
my life to the work of civilizing, educating and Christianizing
the semi-savage Indians of the Maritime Provinces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the next two and a half years he laboured incessantly,
trying to faithfully discharge his duties as a pastor, yet bending
every energy to master the Micmac language. Dr. Rand has been
abundantly censured for “wasting his time over a vanishing language.”
He did not. Would that more of us might waste our time
to such advantage. Here a quotation from the fourteenth annual
report of the Mission may be considered: “The language of the
Micmacs <span class='it'>must decay</span>. If they are brought under the influence of
instruction they will desire to learn English, and yet we do not observe
much progress made even in that. Among themselves they
converse in their own language, and every effort to make ourselves
understood among them must be in a simple conversational style.
They often cannot understand our generally uttered Saxon words,
far less our theological phrases. Let the minister of the Gospel or
Sabbath-school teacher who can, with but little difficulty, make himself
understood to the generality of our white population, endeavor
to make even an ordinarily intelligent Indian acquainted with the
doctrines of the atonement or substitution of Christ in the room of
sinners, and faith in His work, and he will at once see the necessity
for diligent efforts to acquire a knowledge of that peculiar language.
We repeat, the language may be fast disappearing; but it has been
by the exertions of your missionary, reduced to a grammar, and a
dictionary of it is in course of construction: will men of science fail
to acknowledge their obligation to your missionary’s efforts? To the
antiquarian and philologist the cause in which we are engaged has
claims. But, above all, it has been made the vehicle of conveying
the story of the Cross to a portion of our fallen race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Rand’s work, when studying the language, was made less
difficult by securing the assistance of Joe Brooks, an intelligent
Frenchman, whose father was a sailor in the French navy, captured
by the British during the last war, and brought with other prisoners
to Halifax. When liberated, instead of returning to France he
settled at Digby; and his son Joseph, led on by a spirit of adventure,
went into the forest and made his home among the Micmacs, marrying
one of their women. Following the Indian custom, he gave
prominence to the meaning of his name, <span class='it'>Ruisseau</span>, and gave it in
English as Brooks. He had become thoroughly “civilized” according
to the Micmac standard, and, as he was an intelligent man, proved
a great help to the busy minister who was so anxious to learn Micmac
that he would ply him with questions by the hour, noting down
most carefully every answer, until, instead of learning, he could
teach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we go on following Dr. Rand in his life-work, many
readers would like to know more about those pages in his Diary
which are of so much interest to the linguist and the antiquary.
Here let Dr. Rand speak for himself, so that now, as years ago, his
personality may explain his position, and disarm all criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May 6th, 1877.—I do not think I am ambitious of fame, but I
think it meet that friends should know that, proposing to translate
the Scriptures into the languages of the Indians, I can furnish them
with some confidence of my ability in foreign languages and dead
languages. But I fear to spend too much time over it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have received a letter from Jacob Martin stating that his brother
Moses will be willing to assist in translating the Scriptures into Mohawk,
but would prefer coming down to N. S. I am quite taken
with the idea. It would obviate one objection to the work, as I need
not then wholly neglect the Micmacs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“10th.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have studied Mohawk to-day; and corrected
Latin hymns and studied Latin versification by way of relaxation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here it may not be out of place to insert one stanza of the Latin
hymn upon which he was working “by way of relaxation.” The
final form of the stanza will be inserted also, to show his freedom of
expression in Latin. He is translating the hymn, “Just as I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dec. 19th, 1864.—I am deeply impressed this morning with the
grievous backsliding of the times. Surely there are no churches
that at all come up to the requirements of the New Testament, nor
to the description there given of the churches of those early times.
Now, surely this cannot be the way, and there must be a <span class='it'>reform</span>. I
saw and felt this when, in 1842, I was awakened—I may say renewed.
I remember going to Halifax; I addressed the church one
evening, and the next morning just after one of the most heavenly
seasons of communion with God that was ever granted me, good
brother Nutting called, deputed, I presume by (——), advising me
that it would be much better for me to go up into the country, and
giving me to understand that I was excited. So when I addressed
the people at the Association at Wilmot that summer on the reality
of the Gospel and the importance of giving it full credence, and became
very earnest in my appeals, I was immediately put under
medical treatment. Dr. Sawyers was advised to speak to me and
advise me to abstain from every exciting scene and subject, as I was
over-excited, that is, I was bordering on insanity. “So they wrap
it up.” In all ages, those who follow the Lord fully are denounced
as madmen. But shall I be cheated out of heavenly-mindedness and
heaven by such puerilities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am determined to embrace the Gospel with all my heart, and
act upon it. I feel my strength renewed in so doing. I have devoted
my time during the past year, as I never did before since I
commenced the work of this Mission, in seeking first the Kingdom
of God and His righteousness. This last month in the year, which
I might have devoted to the collecting of subscriptions, I have devoted
to the work of the Mission. I have done it deliberately, and
in order to glorify God. I have prayed, and laboured, and looked
up to Him for help. He has already interposed in a most striking
manner to supply present necessities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I now feel satisfied
that the course I am pursuing is right. I can look confidently up to
my Father, and to the Lord Jesus Christ. To Him alone I make
known my wants,—to Him alone I tell my plans. My creditors
know nothing of it; my friends know nothing of my necessities. I
purposely refrain from publishing them, because this would be an
appeal to man after all, and not to God alone. I will let the people
know when the time comes. I now feel, not willing to be deceived,
not willing to find out that all my hopes, my peace, my confidence,
has been delusion; no! I am not willing to find out that; that would
be a most fearful calamity; but I am willing to find out that I have
not learned the whole will of God. I am willing to be made wiser
and better. I am perfectly willing to have my faith and patience
tried, and I am willing to be disappointed in my expectations, provided
this disappointment be sent to teach me wisdom, and show me
a more excellent way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it is the greatest grief that can come to an earnest,
enthusiastic soul to be so grossly misunderstood by his co-labourers;
and it is a melancholy case when worldly men and women take it
upon themselves to explain the difference between being filled with
the Holy Spirit, and being a prey to the vagaries of a crazed imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we turn eagerly to that section of the Diary where he
speaks of the beginning of the Mission.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“January 6th, 1849.—For the last two and a half years my
Journal has been pretty much neglected. It is now resumed. Since
July, 1846, I, with my family have been residing in Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island. The church here is small. I have been
labouring chiefly at Charlottetown.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The principal thing
which has absorbed my attention during the past two years and a
half is the learning of the Micmac language. I have made some
progress. I can converse with them to some extent, read the Scriptures
to them,—having translated about a dozen chapters—and am
compiling quite a full vocabulary of their words. I have met with
some assistance, especially in the officers of H. M. Brig “Gulnare,”
employed in surveying the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feb. 3rd.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Last evening I spent an hour with Captain
Orlebar, at his house. He is interested in the Indians. He has
contributed towards assisting me during the last three years the sum
of about twenty pounds. I have made a good deal of progress in
their language. I am compiling a Dictionary and a Grammar, and
have brought the former down to P. I had an interesting excursion
among the Indians of Nova Scotia when I attended the Association
at Liverpool. I found them friendly and interested. I visited the
Indian settlement at Shubenacadie and spent all night in a camp. I
am now attending a poor sick fellow named Jacob Mitchell. He is
going with the Consumption. Sometimes I hope light is beaming
upon his darkened mind, at others I am discouraged. One thing is
comforting; the work is the <span class='it'>Lord’s</span>. Oh that I could feel more
deeply, and that I could converse with them in their own tongue. I
hope yet to accomplish this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“March 28th, 1849.—Yesterday Dr. Tremain drove me over to
Brother Bain’s. I made a visit to the Indians. Poor Saku Mesal
(Jacob Mitchell) is somewhat better, but I think he cannot live long.
By the aid of his wife I succeeded in going on with my vocabulary,
and worked at it for about four hours. On my return, to my surprise,
I observed a new camp by the roadside, and, naturally enough
called in. Just as I drew aside the <span class='it'>kakun</span>, I heard the old lady say:
“<span class='it'>Jigulase</span>” (be off with you.) “Do you tell me <span class='it'>jigulase</span>?” says I.
“<span class='it'>Mogwa</span>,” said she, “<span class='it'>Piskwa, Piskwa</span>,” (come in, come in.) I
accordingly entered, and found them pleased enough to see me.
The <span class='it'>jigulase</span> was said to be a poor creature who had been drinking,
I imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“April 1st, 1849.—By the “Messenger” I learn that poor Burpee
(Missionary to Burma) is far gone with the consumption. He must
return if he is able. Who will take his place? I have been (or
rather <span class='it'>was</span>) requested to go, and partially consented. Mrs. Rand
objected, and I gave it up; and am reconciled to it with the hope
that I may be able to do something for the poor Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“April 8th, 1849.—An Indian woman called to-day to inform me
that my poor <span class='it'>Nigumach</span>, Saku Mesal, was supposed to be dying.
The Lord knows what is best. I am glad the poor fellow has heard
in his own tongue the wonderful works of God, and that he used to
pay attention. I am, in short, not without hope that his heart had
been changed. “<span class='it'>Kesalt Sasus</span>,” I lately asked him, (Do you love
Jesus?) To which he replied: “<span class='it'>Ah, Kesalt Sasus</span>” (Indeed, I love
Jesus.).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May 21st, 1849.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I go a great part of my time into the
country. My own wish is to devote myself wholly to the Indians.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must draw up a report of my Micmac Mission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“June 7th, 1849.—I have written my report on the Micmac Mission,
and one part has been published in the “Messenger.” I have
requested to be employed wholly in this work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“July 4th.—(At the Association.) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There seemed at one
time no chance for the Micmac Mission. I felt gloomy, but found
comfort casting my care upon the Lord. The cloud burst. I found
that most of the ministers and people were interested in the matter.
One brother—Whitman Freeman—sent me a letter written in part
in Micmac, enclosing 20/. Several other donations were received,
and, at the Home Mission meeting, after I had made an address of
half an hour, the Moderator proposed a collection and subscription
for the Mission. It was acceeded to, and, with what was received
before and after the meeting, £20, 18/4 were received. The Missionary
Board gave me an appointment as their missionary among
the Indians for the ensuing year, with the prospect of obtaining £50
from Nova Scotia; and I am to continue my labours in connection
with the church at Charlottetown if they choose. Hoping to receive
as much as last year, besides what my “Gulnare” friends may obtain
for me. This, I trust, will enable me to live and meet the
expenses of the mission. I am in hopes of making a trip to Cape
Breton in the “Gulnare,” to remain at least two months, to mingle
among the Indians there, to make further progress in the language,
and to do what I can for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he laboured, from the inception of the work, never knowing
when or whence money would come to bear the necessary expenses.
The idea of giving a portion of his income back to the
Lord would have been ridiculous. He gave everything, and every
power he possessed; and Christian people allowed him and his family
to live as best they might on hopes and promises, while he
laboured on as their representative among the Micmacs and Maliseets
of the Maritime Provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There has been, and perhaps yet is a common impression that
the Micmacs are dying out. But anyone who is enough interested
to consult the census reports will see that in spite of disease, and
what we call <span class='it'>civilization</span>, they have been steadily increasing. During
the twenty years, from 1851 to 1871, they increased from 1,056
to 1,666 in Nova Scotia, from 1,116 to 1,403 in New Brunswick,
and from [?] to 323 in Prince Edward Island. Twenty years later
they numbered 2,150 in N. S., 4,511 in N. B., and 321 in P. E. I.
People are deceived by the fact that they are not found in large encampments
now as formerly. Many of them are building houses,
and in other ways adapting themselves to their changed surroundings.
When Dr. Rand took up the work, he felt that even if the
common impression were correct with regard to the language and
people dying out, yet we were none the less under obligation to give
them the Gospel. He felt a glow of enthusiasm, as he realized that
the privilege was his of carrying the Good News in their own tongue
to those who have called our land Magamagee, and Acadie, who have
named our rivers and bays, and in so many places the land from
which an advancing civilization has gradually ejected them that we
may build our homes. Our fathers carried messages of good will to
them from European sovereigns, and made the treaties very plain to
them. The privilege was his and it is ours to do our share towards
making the greatest of all messages plain to every man, woman and
child among them, as among ourselves, for we are all brothers, with
a common hunger for the world’s great need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Rand now had been formally appointed to the work among
the Micmacs by the Baptists of the Maritime Provinces. But the
thought of teaching denominationalism was farthest from his purposes.
He wished to have every Christian in fullest accord with
him, as he went from place to place in the prosecution of his work.
He felt that, in order to get this common sympathy enlisted, a common
responsibility would be an advantage. It was not his purpose
to organize “such as were being saved” into separate churches, but
to confine himself to leading them into the Gospel light, and then
they might unite with whatever churches they wished, or, if they
preferred, remain where they were. His support, too, was coming
from many who were not Baptists, chief among these were Orlebar
and Bayfield of H. M. Brig “Gulnare,” who had collected some
money for him among Episcopalians in England. Everything considered,
it was decided to organize a Micmac Mission irrespective of
denominational lines. Correspondence was opened up, visits were
made, and a representative meeting was arranged for in Halifax,
before which Dr. Rand presented very fully the condition and claims
of the Mission. So great was the enthusiasm of the missionary as
he stood before them, filled with a burning desire to give his life to
the work, and already acquainted with the language, as a result of
more than two and a half years of constant study, that they were all
agreed to go on together with the work, and the Micmac Mission
was organized on the 12th of November, 1849.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first missionaries among the Micmacs, as is well known,
were Roman Catholics, who had begun work almost as soon as
the French first visited Acadian shores. These faithful workers
learned the language and reduced it to writing, using for this purpose
however, not <span class='it'>letters</span> but <span class='it'>characters</span>. The characters used were partly
such as were found in use among the Indians, and partly invented at
the time. In this manner a prayer-book was constructed for their
use, which was almost their only literature for two hundred years.
The book had never been printed, but copied by hand with immense
labour, and committed to memory; the characters, each of which
represented a word, serving as little more than aids to the memory.
As soon as a rival missionary organization appeared in the form of
the Micmac Mission, with Dr. Rand translating the Scriptures into
Micmac, the Roman Catholic authorities hastened to improve their
methods, and, as an offset, had this prayer-book printed at immense
labour and cost, as several dies had to be cut, and types formed to
represent all the words used. It is the work of a clever German
priest, and is a marvel of literary skill and perseverance. I have
almost quoted Dr. Rand here, and he adds: “But so far as <span class='it'>use</span> is
concerned, to say nothing of its theological errors, it is one of the
grossest literary blunders that was ever perpetrated.” Dr. Rand did
not realize then that some of his own translations into Micmac which
were published in Isaac Pitman’s phonetic method might be regarded
very much in the same light by many critics of the following generation,
critics who also say that as the Indians could not read, it seems
absurd to have prepared books for them, especially the Scriptures,
since they were all nominally Roman Catholics, and would not be
allowed to receive them, much less to learn to read them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The labour of the next fifteen years was so exacting that few
entries were made in the Diary, and these few were noted down
hastily in Shorthand. If you, my reader, would know of the weary
hours of toil, and of the victories won, you must kindly wait until a
biography has been written. Dr. Rand was guaranteed a salary, but
the collecting of that salary was left for him to do. Who ever heard
of such a paradox? Meetings must be held far removed from the
scenes of his labours, and people must be entertained and “moved”
before the contribution box was passed. It was during these years
too, that Ben Christmas gave him so much trouble and disappointment,
and on this account many people refused to further aid the
undertaking. Do you wonder that Dr. Rand wearied of collecting
from those who simply contributed to the work in order to smother
down the qualms of conscience? Do you wonder that he found it
difficult to co-operate with people who would leave him to carry the
whole load, while they calmly calculated his progress, or entirely forgot
about the work?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having read the life of David Brainerd, and learning now of
what was called the Muller method of trusting, Dr. Rand was encouraged
to shake himself free from the work of raising funds for
the Mission; and from that time on he looked to God alone for his
support, asking no man for a single cent. How God accepted and
blessed him we shall see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“April 9th, 1865.—(Hantsport.) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Had a good mission
visit to old Brooks’ family. Found the old man very tender. I took
him into the waggon and gave him a drive, and he told me his experience,—quite
satisfactory. He has been in great distress about
his soul, but he has come into liberty. He can rejoice in the Lord;
the Bible is precious to him; he is affected with the love and mercy
of Christ, he is not afraid to die and he wants to be baptized. I have
agreed to drive him through to Hantsport and keep him for a week,
when, if I am satisfied still, I will baptize him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“11th.—I visited Newel yesterday afternoon. He seems to be
sinking rapidly. Read two chapters to him. He listened attentively,
and, when his wife interrupted, he asked her to be quiet, as he wished
to hear. He said he liked to have me come and read to him. I intend
to go often.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“13th.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. News has just been received that General Lee
has surrendered to General Grant, which virtually ends the war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Staid all night at Bro. W. Church’s; rose early and had a quiet
time reading and praying in secret. About nine o’clock I went on
to see the Indians. Mrs. Church expressed a desire to go with me,
so I drove her out to the Forks of the Avon. We had a pleasant
visit. I read several chapters; the story of the crucifixion in
Matthew. They were attentive. I prayed and sang. Mrs. Brooks
appeared pleasant. I remember very well when she used to seem
frightened as though a bear were prowling around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sept. 25th, 1867.—(Charlottetown.) I went to Rosebank, praying
that I might have some success, and expecting some opposition.
Just before arriving at the encampment I turned into the woods and
spent a little time in prayer. I walked up to the first wigwam, found
the man outside pounding splits. He seemed friendly; conversed
freely; when his wife came out and invited me in. I entered, and
soon produced my book and read Genesis 1-2-3. After conversing
a while I bid them good-bye, and walked on. Stopped to converse
a little with Peter Mitchell, who was building a canoe. He was
short and crusty; I walked on, and found a good-looking fellow outdoors
at his work. I sat down on the shavings and entered into
conversation with him. “Old Jim” Mitchell soon made his appearance,
and pretty soon, in a loud excited voice enquired what the Lord
required of us; but he gave me but little chance to answer his question.
I said “I’ll read you the question and the answer,” so I turned
to John VI., 28-29, and read. I continued reading until he interrupted
me; and soon Peter made his appearance, and a woman who
chimed in with “Old Jim.” Peter seemed quite zealous, ordered me
to decamp, flourished his crooked knife at me, and talked big. I
quietly kept my reclining posture, telling him that I should attend to
my business, and he must attend to his, that he was under no obligation
to hear me, and might go away if he chose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I felt a
little thrill of holy delight at this little specimen of persecution, it
seemed to draw me nearer to the Apostles, and to our blessed Lord.
Met an intelligent Indian at the market-house from Malpec with
whom I conversed for some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During his visit to Cavendish on October 27th, 1864, he spoke
of visiting at the home of David McNeill. While there he preached
in the Presbyterian Church. He mentions that no collection was
asked for or taken, but some small sums of money were handed to
him; then, giving this as a sample of many entries, to quote his own
words: “Next morning Mrs. Murray, wife of the minister, called
on us before breakfast, and brought us a donation of ten shillings.
Soon after another friend called and handed me two pairs of socks
and a five shilling bill. Soon, another five shilling bill was given me
by the young man at whose house we had been lodged. The evening
before, Mrs. John McNeill had asked us to call and see her husband
who is troubled with asthma. We called and had a good visit.
I read the 21st of Revelation, and commented on the glorious city.
As we came away Mrs. McN. put a pound note into my hand. This
made, presents and all, three pounds, two and sixpence, and they
may take a collection besides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These donations, given and received in this way, make, I must
say, a sweet impression upon my heart. I take them as coming
more immediately from my Heavenly Father than if they had been
solicited personally by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monday, 15th Feb., 1869.—(Halifax.)—I have only six cents.
I wish much to obtain some things for my wife. I think I will purchase
them. I thought of going home to-day; I think now that I
will wait till morning. I have been constantly praying for mercy
and grace to help in time of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“16th.—Called at Avery and Brown’s Drug Store and obtained a
piece of “diacoln (?) plaster!” Mr. Brown, to whom I had given
a report, and then afterwards on Sunday had met at our meeting at
the Poor House, came out of the office and slipped a half-sovereign
into my hand. I called on Dr. Hattie; found him sick and confined
to his house. We had a sweet long talk on the best of themes. We
prayed together. He handed me two and a half dollars. The evening
was stormy; I slept comfortably; this morning the rain was
pouring down; I had some misgivings about plunging out into it, but
rose, took some bread and butter and watched for the cars. I considered
that I could ride inside to Windsor, and should the rain continue
I could remain there until it ceased. It held up about ten
o’clock. I reached home about one. Found all well; two letters
had been received and four dollars. A letter from Tom Brooks,
and one from Matilda Condon. Found the boys better. Willie
seems still quite ill, but we have all been attacking the wood-pile
lustily. I see that during the week I have received in all $52.52.
Thanks be to Him who has heard my prayers. On Feb. 9th I wrote
thus:—“Could I say to my friends that I need ten pounds by Saturday
night, how many would assist me? I shall tell them no such
thing, but I will tell my Lord and my God, and He will help me; I
feel a sweet assurance which I here record. I now look up to Him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was six days ago. I can now record the answer to my
prayers. Bless the Lord: O my soul, and all that is within me bless
His holy name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feb. 21st.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I went out to see the Indians at “Micmac
Corner” last evening; I must say I was shocked at the filth and degradation
witnessed. I am determined to take up my cross and go
out to-day, and read the word of the Lord to them. I do deeply feel
my impotency, my utter helplessness in this great matter, but I am
consoled with the thought that the “cause is the Lord’s,” and the
kingdom is His. I am required “to be found faithful;” this is a
great matter; but I am not required to be found “successful!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I prayed earnestly this morning for grace to overcome all reluctance
to labour among the Indians. Went out at eleven o’clock, and read
several Psalms and chapters. After dinner went out again. Found
two or three anxious to learn to read, and who are making good
progress. Invited them to come in and see me during the evenings
of this week and I would instruct them. Called on several families,
and read, explained and prayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often when Dr. Rand was sick, or jaded with excessive work,
the stinging lash of unfriendly criticism seemed to immediately benefit
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Oct. 9th, 1875, at a time when he was laid aside by fever,
he writes:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was an article in the “Messenger” yesterday in
reply to my notice that appeared some time ago with reference to the
Micmac Mission, full of banter and ridicule. I have some idea of
replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oct. 10th.—Sent a reply yesterday to the “Messenger” to the
man who bantered me. I have rested well, I rose early and feel
well. Ate a hearty breakfast. Read 1st and 2nd Timothy nearly all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oct. 11th.—I feel a shrinking from attacking the Micmac. My
head was so whirled about with that language when the fever came
on that I seem to want to rest from it for awhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oct. 12th.—Rursus scribendum est mihi Latine. Valetudo mea
crescit in dies, et hodie valeo. Versum tempestas est pluvialis, et
frigida. Igitur debet me in domo quiescere donec sol splenderet, et
ser dilucidus esset et calidus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord’s Day, Aug. 6th, 1874.—Came to Bear River (Elsetkook)
day before yesterday. Found letters from home. Yesterday forenoon
it rained heavily, cleared off in afternoon. I went up to Cakwogook
and had an interesting time. Met Joseph Salome and found
him at the house of a Frenchman named Cumean whose wife is part
Indian. He lives in quite a respectable looking house. He invited
me in. I found Salome more kind than ever before. Toosei has
been down, and I find that he has been reading the Scriptures and
talking with Salome. I spoke to the Frenchman, and sang a hymn
in French; quite a company gathered around before we ended our
conversation. I read several chapters in Exodus. To-day I am to
preach to the white people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sept. 3rd.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the afternoon went to see Ben Brooks.
Found quite a number there. Read chapters 13-17 of John’s Gospel.
Had quite a little meeting. Read the story of Tobit in Castelio’s
Latin translation. What a ridiculous story mixed with many
pious meditations and prayers and sayings. How different it is after
all from real Scripture! I think there is internal evidence that it was
composed before the destruction of the second Temple, and after the
destruction of the first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spent the forenoon at home reading and studying the Bible,
chiefly in Castelio’s Latin version. In the afternoon I went to see
Ben Brooks. Read from my Revised Version in Micmac the 14th
and on to the 19th inclusive. I had him, his daughter, and son and
daughter-in-law for very attentive auditors. He told me that the
priests tried to get them to burn our books.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Writing of his work after almost twenty-five years’ labour, Dr.
Rand says: “But a small number have openly renounced their connection
with the Romish Church; but I have reason to know that a
widespread enquiry has been awakened among them. Of several I
have good reason to hope. But I have never made it a special and
direct object to induce them to “change their religion,” as it is
called, and especially during the past few years, I have been so
dissatisfied with the Protestant churches generally, that I have had
no heart to urge the Indians, even if I believed them converted, to
leave their church and join ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At another time, writing of particular cases of blessing among
the Micmacs, he says:—“Yes, indeed, I mind me of Joe Brooks,
my first Indian teacher, for whose conversion I long waited and
prayed, and the tears and the sobs came well nigh choking me with
joy, not grief, as I remember I found him once in the neighborhood
of Wolfville, ill in body, and still more so in mind, under a deep
sense of his sins. And then how his eyes sparkled when, about a
fortnight after, he told me he had found peace—living about a year
after, a consistent, devoted life, and dying full of joy and peace, in
the neighbourhood of St. John, N. B., and little <span class='it'>Mose</span>, his son, went
about the same time in peace. Then I think of Lewie Brooks, another
son, with whom I often took sweet counsel, and who assured
me those precious books, those Gospels and Psalms sustained him
through the hours of agony he had often to endure from that terrible
disease, the asthma; and from whom the priest laboured in vain to
wrest and burn the books he so highly prized. In relating the story
he said: “They cannot get the books away from us.” And then
follows his daughter, Mrs. Paul, who died here at Hantsport some
years later, who gave us the most satisfactory evidence that, living
and dying, she was the Lord’s. Then I think of Newton Glode,
(Claude) and his brother Joe, two of the finest young men I ever
knew, residing formerly in Annapolis County, but living at the end
of their earthly career at Cornwallis, who for industry, honesty, and
everything good, would have adorned any rank or condition of life.
What joyful times we had together over the Word, and were not the
Christian friends who often visited them in their last sickness, delighted
to tell me of the proofs they gave of their firm, unshaken
trust in the Lord Jesus. And then I think of little Harriet Christmas
(daughter of poor Ben, and his excellent, amiable Christian wife,)
whose remarkable death and angelic faith Rev. Mr. Dimock of
Truro, her minister, described so beautifully in the <span class='it'>Christian Messenger</span>
at the time. And Newel also, her eldest brother, who lingered
in peace and hope for months, and died in Yarmouth some years
ago, of whom from his mother and others I heard a most satisfactory
account. And I must not pass over another Joe Glode who
closed his career in Kentville a year or two ago. Yes, and there
had been another Joe, Joe Michæl, who will be remembered possibly,
as having been sick all one winter near Upper Dyke Village,
who, with very little help had learned to read those wonderful books,
so dreaded by the agents of Romanism, and the contents of which
had cheered him as he walked through the dark valley, some twenty
years ago. Nor may I forget to mention John Paul, whose happy
death inspired me at the time not only to continue in my work, but
to write the verses on the “Dying Indian’s Dream,” for which I
have received so many thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These, and they are not all, of those who have gone, and who
in life and death have cheered the heart of the writer, amidst all the
“discouraging history of the Micmac Mission.” And perhaps I
could name as many or more among the living were it proper to do
so, of whom I have good hope. The Lord be praised!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, names and numbers aside, can we doubt that the Word of
God may have been blessed to many souls of whom we know nothing.
It was only by an apparent accident that I learned Joe Michæl could
read the Scriptures.” “How did you learn?” I inquired of him.
“Ben Brooks taught me the sounds of the letters, and I drilled out
the rest by myself,” he replied. “I saw him but a few times. One
day I passed the encampment, and all the rest were away, and
he was alone. As I went up to his wigwam I stood and listened
with great interest for a while before I went in. He was reading
the Scriptures in Micmac, and the interview that followed I shall
not soon forget. And I heard of a case at Shubenacadie where a
priest went to see a young Indian who was dying of consumption.
He found him reading the Gospel. He snatched the book out of the
poor fellow’s hand and committed it to the flames. But he soon
found out, and had to confess to the boy, that he had been rash, and
difficult was it to obtain a hearing from the indignant and outraged
“untutored Indian.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “A white man once consented to carry
me to an Indian’s hut, which we reached in a boat.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
never learned what the effect was on them, but the gentleman who
was with me assured me afterwards that it was the means of his own
conversion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One more extract written two years before his death, which
leaves the robe of responsibility resting upon all Christians, and we
are done for the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May 26th, 1888.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They (the Micmacs) have equal
access to the free schools with all others, and are extensively taking
advantage of the privilege. Let them mingle with their white
brothers, learn the arts of civilization as they are doing, and become
useful citizens. Let the white people abandon their abominable
and unreasonable ideas of caste. Let the ministers, everywhere,
each look upon the Indians in his neighborhood as a part of his
charge like all other poor sinners—then there will be no need of a
separate Mission and a separate establishment for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here one can almost see the aged warrior,—for his incessant
labour, and his malady which made it necessary for him to carry
a surgical instrument with him for years, had at last weakened his
wonderful vitality—like the venerable Apostle Paul whom he resembled
in so many respects, at last saying: “I have fought the
good fight, I have finished my course.” And the burden passes
from his shoulders, not to those of one other, but to many others, as
he cheerfully goes on to walk with God in that larger and fuller life.
Let it be said to our shame that we, who were entrusted with that
burden, have not discharged our trust as faithfully as it was our
privilege to have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did the venerable Dr. Rand labour on incessantly day
after day, a faithful representative of the meek and lowly Jesus. I
might give you page after page from his Diary which records his heart-searching
questionings, and his exuberant exclamations of joy over
victories of which God alone knew the magnitude. Page after page
might be transcribed until the volume would be as large as that
which records the labours of David Brainerd, which this in character
so much resembles; but my present purpose is accomplished; a
glimpse has been given of Dr. Rand, the Micmac Missionary, at his
life-work; and, <span class='it'>Kespeadooksit</span>,—the story is ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be that at some future time a life of the remarkable man
may be written, narrating in order all the incidents from his birth at
Brooklyn Street, Cornwallis, N. S.; his lessons respecting truth and
righteousness learned when ten years old at his grandmother Tupper’s
knee; his experiences on the farm, at his trade, in school, and
in the work of the pastorate; his unremitting toil as Missionary to
the Micmacs; and all the rewards that came to him, encouraging
him to press on in spite of every discouragement. Mention might
here be made, however, of the letter from Gladstone, saying: “I at
once admit that your version of the ‘Rock of Ages’ is more exact
than mine;” and of his having received the degree of L.L.D. from
Queen’s College, that of D.D. from Acadia, and that of D. C. L.
from Kings,—fitting acknowledgments of his remarkable achievements
and contributions towards the progress of mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, come with me, and let us rest for a moment where I sat
last June in the Cemetery at Hantsport. There stands a neat red
granite monument, erected by his daughter, bearing this inscription:</p>

</div>

<h3>1. MISSIONARY LABOR.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>This has been continued as usual. Indians have been visited
at Hantsport, Cornwallis, Mount Uniacke, Londonderry, Amherst,
Shediac and St. John, N. B. My reception has been uniformly
kind, and without an exception good attention has been given to the
Word of God, and to religions instruction. My aim has been to
explain the way of salvation, and to direct them to the Lamb of God
which taketh away the sins of the world. White friends have occasionally
accompanied me on these visits. Invariably the solemn
attention witnessed has surprised, impressed and pleased them.
They have owned that, had they been unacquainted with the facts of
the case, they could never have imagined these people to be other
than Protestants and devout Christians. For the sake of brevity I
will omit details except in two cases. In one place in New Brunswick,
I visited within a radius of about seven or eight miles, four
small encampments, and some of them twice. The chief resided
there and I called on him twice. I have known him for years.
He treated me very courteously and at our last interview asked me
to tell him more particularly what my object is in going round among
the Indians. I told him. I said, I am a minister of the Gospel.
My sole business as such is to read, and expound the Word of God,
both publicly and privately, both among the white people and among
the Indians, to teach the way of salvation and to urge people to love
and serve our Lord Jesus Christ. I told him further that since I
could speak Micmac, and read the Scriptures in their language, that
I took special delight in going among them, to lead and sing and
pray, and talk with them of their soul’s salvation. He enquired
how the Indians around in that place received me. I hesitated for
a moment whether I ought to tell him, as it might possibly be the
means of bringing some of them into trouble. But after a little
reflection and silent prayer, I resolved to conceal nothing. They
receive me kindly, said I, as they now do everywhere in Nova Scotia—they
listen attentively and invite me to repeat my visits. “Well,”
he answered, “that is just what I was going to say to you. But you
don’t come often enough, nor early enough in the day. We have
been looking for you ever since your last visit, when you promised
to come again, and now it is so near night and you are in such a
hurry that we have not time to ask you half the questions we wish to
ask, nor to learn half the things we wish to learn. We want you to
come in the morning and stay with us all day.” Such in substance
was the statement of this worthy chief. Surely no one can reasonably
blame me for wishing to continue steadfast, unmovable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord, while even such evidence
is afforded that our labors are not in vain in the Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second incident has reference to the Maliseets, near St.
John. They speak a dialect differing materially from Micmac—and
usually live in houses or small huts. I can speak but a few words
or sentences in their tongue—but we have published a tract in it
which I can read, as can also many of themselves—I can also sing
Psalms and Hymns in Maliseet, and as most of them speak Micmac
and English tolerably well, we get on sometimes very bravely together.
One evening I had entered a hut, as the sun was setting,
had received a cordial welcome, had sung in Maliseet,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Abide with me, fast falls the eventide;”</p>

<p class='noindent'>had spoken of Christ and his readiness to save, and now, said I, if
you have no objections, I wish to kneel down in your hut and pray.
“Certainly,” replied the man, “certainly,” and he and I bowed
down together, though his wife, the only other person present, did
not kneel, and I prayed. “Thank you, thank you,” said he as we
arose—“that’s good, that’s very nice. It isn’t often we gets the likes
o’ that here. It’s cus and swear and get drunk—that’s what we
usually gets.” The words of the poor fellow and his earnest manner
touched my heart. I could not but bless God that I am permitted by
his grace—to visit the Indian’s lowly dwelling, to talk and sing and
read of a Saviour’s love, and pray, where so many go merely for
pastime—to curse and swear, and drink; but where few, alas, go to
pray. People sometimes express astonishment that I can persevere
and not get discouraged in the cultivation of so stubborn a soil,
where so much labor and toil require to be expended, and so little
fruit is seen. And I am sometimes amazed at it myself. But there
is in my soul a deep-seated feeling that I am called to the work in
which I am engaged, and incidents like the above wring tears from
my eyes, bring me to my knees, and send me on in my work refreshed,
and strengthened, with loins fresh-girded to the conflict,
and full of joy and hope.</p>

<h3>2. PECUNIARY SUPPORT.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Since Jan. 1st, 1865, up to the present time, Jan. 5th, 1866, I
have received in aid no less than one thousand and sixty-five dollars
and eighty-one cents. Thirty-seven dollars, twenty-one and a half
cents have reached me since the present year commenced, though
most of it was mailed sometime before. During the year my former
allowance of two hundred pounds, with forty pounds for travelling
expenses, has been received, and seventy-five dollars, nine cents and
a half, over and above. Last spring, after listening to a charity
sermon by Rev. D. Freeman of Canning, Cornwallis, I determined
to lay by in store every Lord’s day, one tenth of all receipts during
the previous week, to be expended in charity; to be laid up in
heaven at a hundred fold interest against the time to come, and having
followed up this plan, I have been enabled to devote not only the
former allowance of forty dollars to charity; but more than double
that sum, and have been prospered in proportion. By far the
largest amount received during any period of three months, was
received during the quarter just closed, the amount for the quarter
being three hundred and eighty-six dollars, thirty-three and a half
cents. And the most of it came in since the 26th day of October.
That day must ever be a memorable one to me. In order to encourage
my Christian brethren in the ministry and out of it, to pray
more, and to believe more firmly, and to wait on the Lord for temporal
blessings as well as spiritual, always remembering to put the
spiritual far in advance of the temporal,—I will relate the events of
that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under ordinary circumstances, I must have been anxious and
troubled. I had no money, no salary, almost no food for a large
family, and winter with all its peculiar wants was at hand. Besides
all this I was in debt. When I struck a balance with the society on
the old plan last year, my salary was three hundred dollars in arrears,
and I needed all that money to meet demands against me. It
seemed a strange way to get out of debt, to forgive all one’s debtors.
But so I read, as applicable to myself under the circumstances, the
sweet petition taught me in my infancy, and repeated ever since;
but never half believed or understood. I had determined to look to
my Father in Heaven for the means of paying my honest debts, as
well as for the support of my family, and to ensure his blessing I
meant to do everything he required of me, to please Him in all
things. By His grace I determined that no bills for 1865 should be
sent in at the year’s end, and that as many as possible of the former
ones should be paid. But on the day mentioned, Oct. 26th, with all
our other wants, there were debts to be paid. No one was pushing
us, but the honor of God was concerned and our own credit, and the
people we owed ought to have their money. So I entered into my
closet, and shut the door, and prayed to my Father who is in secret,
and my Father who seeth in secret has according to His promise
rewarded me openly. For several hours He seemed to hold me at a
distance, but, as in the beautiful example held up for imitation of
the Syro-Phœnician woman, I was enabled to struggle on and get
nearer and nearer to His blessed feet. Then came triumph, peace,
thanksgiving and joy. All the evening the language of my heart
could be best expressed in Psalm 103. “Bless the Lord, O my soul,
and all that is within me, bless His holy name!” I awoke the next
morning in the same tranquil thankful frame of mind. My plans
for the future all opened out distinctly before me while on my knees.
Then came deliverance. The mail that day brought me a letter
containing twelve dollars, greatly needed that very day, and mailed
to me the day before, while I was fasting and praying. In three
days after that I had received money enough to meet all the pressing
necessities of the family, and since that memorable day, without the
slightest trouble or anxiety on my part, without having given even a
hint of my necessities to any mortal, and without having asked even
for a public collection, I have received—nearly all in money—no
less than four hundred and three dollars and eighty-seven cents. I
have not been able to pay all old bills, and meet daily wants. But
the amount of debt has been greatly reduced, and all fear for the
future has been removed. Thanks be to God who heareth prayer,
and thanks to the friends who have been prompted to aid us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With great reluctance I refrain at present from publishing
extracts from many of the letters which I have received during the
year, containing contributions to the mission, and breathing encouragement
to myself, kindness to the Indians, and love to the precious
Redeemer. Suffice it to say that the hand of God has been strikingly
manifest in many of the contributions received throughout,
and particularly during the last quarter. I cannot withhold the
following letter received from a poor orphan girl, a school-teacher in
New Brunswick, enclosing as a “birthday offering,” a piece of gold,
value $2.50. “Rev. Sir, when two weeks ago the enclosed piece of
gold was handed me, I was immediately impressed with a desire to
send it to you for your great mission. Not knowing the best manner
of doing so, I made it a subject of prayer. Your own acquaintance
with the willingness of the precious Redeemer to hear and answer
prayer, will reveal to you my joy at hearing you were actually in the
place. I will add no more, except, ‘The Lord is my Shepherd, I
shall not want.’ Such a contribution and letter require no comment.
In ways as unlooked for, have five cent pieces, five dollar pieces,
five pound pieces, with sums of intermediate value, been received,
and the gold and silver have seemed to sparkle with a celestial lustre
as they have been dropped as if by angel fingers into my hands.
Even the love of money may be lawful when it is inspired by the
love of Christ, when the money is consecrated to Him, and used
for His glory and the best interests of man. Surely under such
circumstances it is neither filthy lucre nor the Mammon of unrighteousness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another friend writes: “I am much pleased with the stand you
have taken. Since I saw you I have had about eighteen hundred
pounds removed from under my stewardship, making, with other
losses, more than four thousand pounds. But as my Heavenly
Father has done it, it is all right.” The brother goes on to speak
of his tranquility of mind in submitting to privation and suffering,
and sends the handsome sum of four dollars, evidently a thank-offering
to the Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know not who the author of the following is: “Dear Brother,
I herewith enclose to you four dollars, to be appropriated either for
your own immediate requirements, or for the prosecution of the
Micmac Mission as you may deem best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have every confidence in your work of faith, and would say
persevere. I fully believe that the prayer of faith is answered by
the Almighty. Pray, brother Rand, for my dear wife, who is yet, I
fear, without Christ. My heart would rejoice in her conversion. I
long for it. Yours, &amp;c., A Sincere Friend.”</p>

<h3>3. CONCLUDING REFLECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Thus has closed what has been in some respects one of the
most eventful years of the Mission. The plan of “Trusting in the
Lord” for support—“Muller’s plan,” as it is called, but which, in
reality, dates much further back—found at first but little favor in
the eyes of our friends. It might do, they said, for England, but
not for Nova Scotia,—as though the Lord were not the same everywhere.
It was looked upon as an experiment, and one that would
probably fail. But a plan upon which scores of ministers and
missionaries both at home and in heathen lands have acted for years,
and acted successfully, can hardly be regarded as an experiment. I
cannot but hope that not only my own faith, but that of many others
has been somewhat strengthened already. My desire to continue in
the same course has been increased. The Lord can and will give
us more grace, and we will go forward in His strength, giving to
Him all the glory, and making mention of His righteousness, even
of His only.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='page33'><span class='sc'>our success in distributing the</span><br/> <span class='sc'>scriptures among the</span><br/> <span class='sc'>indians.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to have before us distinctly the subject, we must take
into account the condition of the Micmacs when we began our
labours, the obstacles we have had to encounter, and then the
achievements that have been made. The whole can be summed up
very briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I began my labours in the year 1840—nearly forty years ago.
I was thirty-six years old. The Indians, so far as civilization was
concerned, with very few exceptions, were in the same condition
that they had been for two hundred years before. Nominally they
were Roman Catholics; they had great confidence in their priests,
but as to the Bible they did not know there was such a book, and had
they known there was such a book, there was no possibility of their
knowing what was in it. Not more than one in a thousand could
read English, even imperfectly, and that one—and others to my
certain knowledge—could not understand what he read, even in
the plainest spelling-book. Most carefully had they been guarded
against attending the Protestant schools, and adopting the habits of
the white people, and their priests carefully abstained from teaching
them to read, lest—as we have their own statements to prove—they
might read books that would undermine their faith. They have not
only not given the Indians the Holy Scriptures, but have used all
sorts of means, foul and fair, to prevent them from receiving them
and learning to read them. Such was the condition of things forty
years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This shows of itself what were some of the chief obstacles
we had to meet and overcome. But there were others, and these
were formidable. To have attempted to instruct them through the
medium of the English language would at the time have been simple
folly. To have attempted to teach them our language without understanding
theirs, and while they had no wish to learn ours, and no
possible means of learning it, even had they wished it, would have
been simply the scheming of insanity. The task of learning the
Micmac language under the circumstances, without books, without
a competent teacher, and with all the zeal and ardor of the Roman
Catholic hierarchy, and the prejudices and the suspicions of the
tribe aroused against us to prevent it needs only to be mentioned to
be appreciated. With all the natural talent with which God had
endowed me for the work, for which I am amply credited, if any
one imagines the task was easily accomplished, I can only say he is
<span class='it'>very much mistaken</span>. If the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ had not been with me, encouraging and aiding me in a most
marvellous manner, it never would or could have been done. <span class='it'>But it
was done</span>, blessed be His name forever!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now what is the condition of things at the present day?
Why the whole New Testament, with several books of the old, viz.,
Genesis, Exodus, Psalms,—in Micmac, and the Gospel of John in
Maliseet, the language of the St. John Indians, as they are sometimes
called, have been published. Scores of the Indians have
learned to read them, hundreds have heard them read; they know
everywhere now that there is such a book as the Bible. Scores of
copies have been distributed among them, and the priests are powerless
to prevent it. Furthermore, numbers have given evidence of
having received the truth of the Gospel in the love of it, and by their
consistent lives and triumphant deaths, have given proof of the
reality of the grace they professed to have received. And mark the
change which has taken place in the condition of the tribe in respect
to <span class='it'>civilization</span> since we began our labours, and as the direct result of
our labours. To what else is all this to be ascribed? Certainly it
has not been achieved by the Roman Catholic Church, because it has
been achieved <span class='it'>in spite of</span> that church. The old dress both of men
and women has been discarded, and that of the white people adopted
very generally; you can no longer tell an Indian by his dress.
Comfortable houses and all the appearance of civilization, are continually
to be met with. Everywhere there is a determination to
obtain learning, and to learn the English language. Indian children
to some extent attend the English schools which are now open to all,
and many adults have mastered the mysteries of reading Micmac,
one at least now living, after forty years of age who never went to
school at all. I have, within the last three or four years, seen
Indians all the way from Topique, Fredericton, St. John, The Restigouche,
Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton; in all these places
I have distributed copies of the Scriptures and of a small volume
entitled “A First Reading Book in Micmac and English;” and in
all these places I have found intelligent Indians who could read them,
and have been most kindly and cordially received and listened to by
them, as I read and preached and prayed and sang hymns to them
in their own tongue; and I have scarcely met with what deserved
the name of opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have never taken a particular account of books distributed,
and I have never charged the Indians anything for copies of the
Scriptures. I could never make up my mind to that. We have
treated the Indians in this Province with such outrageous wrong,
that I would gladly undo that had I the power. We have seized
upon their lands, destroyed their means of living, destroyed <span class='it'>them</span>,
corrupted their morals in every way,—and for Christian men, after
all this, to say to them: “We will not <span class='it'>give</span> you the Word of God
unless you <span class='it'>pay</span> for it,” it seems to me would be the wildest wickedness,
from which all those who have any regard for God or conscience,
should devoutly pray: “<span class='it'>Good Lord deliver us!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The B. &amp; F. Bible Society furnished the means of printing
Genesis, Exodus, Psalms and three of the Gospels and Acts in
Micmac, and the Gospel of John in Maliseet. The rest of the New
Testament was published—one thousand copies, by private subscriptions
for that very purpose, chiefly in England, but some of it came
from France and other places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are now in Halifax unbound about nine hundred copies.
All that were bound, about eight or nine years ago, have been distributed.
What I now ask is, that money may be furnished for
binding a portion at least of the rest. They can be bound for ——</p>

<p class='pindent'>I may add that I have in manuscript a translation of the Books
of Job and of Jonah, and some of the other narratives of the Old
Testament. Genesis is out of print, and so is the Gospel of John in
Maliseet, the greater portion of these having been destroyed by fire,
the former in a great conflagration in Halifax many years ago, and
the latter in the recent great fire in St. John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I enclose herewith a few letters that have [been] received from
different places requesting books for the Indians, the most of them
written by Indians themselves. In very many cases I have taken
down their names, as I have been on my missionary excursions, at
their request, and sent them books by mail. These letters speak
for themselves. They prove two things; that there are Indians that
can read and write, and that they receive and value the books that
are printed in their own tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this suggestive couplet the Legends, or Ahtookwokun of the
Micmacs, in their original form, almost invariably commence. The
inseparable introduction shows us how the literature of the people
had long ago taken on a settled form, even though there were no
written records; it confirms to a considerable degree the common
impression that they had a ballad arrangement, and were chanted to
weird music in that ancient time; and also indicates how carefully
the old men cherish the memory of their former greatness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people look upon their folk-lore as a sacred treasure to
be carefully preserved by their holy men; and, as in our Saxon
traditions the dying Bleys relates the story of Arthur’s birth, so an
aged Sakumow may be heard repeating the immortal legends to
faithful witnesses, just before he passes on to the regions of the far
West, where Glooscap dwells in the presence of the Great Spirit,
and where the golden sunsets give us foregleams of that beautiful
abode, the happy hunting-ground of the faithful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us approach the study of Micmac Mythology with a becoming
reverence, for we are dealing with sacred things; and, as we learn
what little we can about a vanishing religion, may we not join with
the great American poet in the hope</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“That the feeble hands and helpless</p>

<p class='line'>And are lifted up and strengthened.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Silas T. Rand, to whom we are indebted for all we know
about the ancient religion of the people, thought that a number of
the Micmac Legends might be Bible narratives, not any more
changed than one would expect after centuries of transmission by
word of mouth alone. Professor E. N. Horsford, through whose
foresight and generosity the legends were published, and Mr.
Charles G. Leland, who has a very interesting collection of Algonquin
Legends, were both persuaded that several of the stories must have
come either direct from hardy Norsemen, or from the Norsemen
through the Eskimo. The two legends that perhaps most closely
resemble traditions found in Iceland are “The Adventures of Kaktoogwasees”
and “The Beautiful Bride,” the former the thirteenth
and the latter the twenty-fourth in Dr. Rand’s collection; they relate
almost identical incidents, in the same order, and must have started
from the same original, whether Norse or not. The variations
which led Dr. Rand to consider them separate stories are probably
due to some narrators having confined their attention chiefly to the
attractive bride, while others had taken more delight in picturing the
rugged qualities of the young Thunderer and his companions.
Carefully comparing the two stories, we see that Glooscap acts a
prominent part in each, always proving himself a faithful friend.
He allows the travellers the use of his <span class='it'>kweedun</span>, or canoe, which is
a small rocky island covered with a low growth of trees, and, more
wonderful still! the <span class='it'>kweedun</span> travels without the use of paddles
wherever the owner may wish. In both tales we find a man so swift
of foot that it is necessary for him to keep one leg tied up firmly to
his body, except on great occasions, for when both legs are free, he
cannot by any means control his actions; and, when the great occasion
comes for an exhibition of his magic, he makes a complete circle
around the earth, carrying a brimming goblet of water, in somewhat
less than thirty minutes, thus winning the laurels for his party. In
both tales, too, we find a magician who keeps the hurricane securely
fastened within his nostrils, and it is very interesting when he
removes the stoppages and breathes freely, raising a tempestuous
sea, and laying waste whole areas of forest. Kaktoogwasees, the
young Thunderer, has better magic in his party than all his enemies
combined, and we do not hesitate to congratulate him as he leads
home his beautiful bride, the daughter of the Earthquake, who, as
described in Legend XXIV., has hair as glossy black as the wing of
the raven, cheeks of crimson, and a brow as white as January snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Rand says: “I have not found more than five or six Indians
who could relate these queer stories, and most, if not all of these,
have now gone. Who the original author was, or how old they are
we have no means of knowing.” It is evident that several have been
borrowed from the Russians and the Eskimo; such, for example, as
relate to characters having flinty hearts, or who keep their hearts
hidden away within some half-dozen concentric coatings, living or
dead and perhaps all hidden away in the bottom of the sea. Also,
if we compare Legend III. in Dr. Rand’s collection with the one
entitled “The Weaver’s Son” in Jeremiah Curtin’s “Folklore of
Ireland,” we must be convinced that the Micmac Legend is an
incomplete version of the Irish story. Some of the Legends may
have been borrowed from every people with whom the Micmacs
came in contact since their ancestors first began to wander from the
highlands of Asia; but, granting that all tales bearing such resemblances
have been borrowed, it may still be reasonably supposed that
most of the Legends of the Micmacs are simply the crystalized
thought of a people who had a keen appreciation of the beautiful,
living as they did season after season in the most intimate contact
with the varied manifestations of nature,—a people whose restless
minds were ever on the alert to find some explanation of the workings
of that</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many people cannot think of mythology without seeing confused
apparitions of Zeus with his family of gods and goddesses on old
Olympus, but here, among the earliest Acadians, we find traditions
which, when organized into a system will be worthy of the most
careful study. Dr. Rand, who translated the legends and recorded
them for us, did not make any attempt to classify the characters,
and for that very reason his work is of the greater value to science,
since he was not hunting up a basis for any theory of his own. Mr.
Leland has made a beginning, in the way of grouping related stories;
but someone might well spend half a life-time in opening up this
promising mine, and placing Micmac Mythology, as it surely
deserves to be placed, on an equality with our accepted Classics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may seem a rash statement, and evince a poor appreciation
for the classic authors we have read, but there are those who are
persuaded that in the Mythology of the Americans, as in that of our
fathers, the Norsemen, we find a rugged strength and a manly
purity which is very obscure if not altogether unknown among those
imaginary characters which grew up in the minds of the ancient
Greeks, and later became the property of Rome and the world.
True, the tales of the northern nations are not so gracefully told,
and themselves lack the perfect etiquette we find among the Greeks;
but for strength, and brilliancy of conception, surely those great
characters rudely sketched in black and white have a stimulating
suggestiveness that is altogether obscure amid the milder tones and
softly blending harmonies of the polished ideals of the East. Philosophers,
who know, tell us that we of Northern climes cannot
worship, or love, or even hate with that refinement of cruelty which
those experience who bask in brighter sunshine beneath a milder
sky. Suppose we yield them the palm in this respect, are we not
more than repaid by the dignity and majesty that comes with the
consciousness of being master of the fury of the elements! Such
dignity did the Micmac heroes have; and the ideals of the people
left its impress upon the character of the nation, until the necessity
of self-preservation, and the slip-shod policy of their conquerors,
destroyed every noble ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Micmac Mythology we have a plant of native growth which
bids fair to be as beautiful and profitable as any of the famous
exotics; shall we not cultivate it with some of the attention we now
bestow upon Greek Mythology? and as we study the story of Acadian
heroes,—rugged, strong, and beautiful in their primeval simplicity,
may we not hope to hear a deep voice speaking to us through the
shady vistas of the past, and saying:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Be thou a hero, let thy might</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Tramp on the eternal snows its way,</p>
<p class='line'>And through the ebon walls of night,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Carve out a passage unto day.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of the eighty-seven stories in Dr. Rand’s collection many are
pure and simple myths; some are mythical with an evident purpose
to teach some practical lesson, and so may be considered fables or
parables; while still others are merely records of history, somewhat
mythical, perhaps, and yet no doubt largely the record of facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the feature that most impresses itself upon the careful
reader is the number of instances in which weakness overcomes all
obstacles. Frail children and dwarfs are able by the use of magic
to overcome fabulous monsters, and destroy whole families of giants
with such weapons as a spear made from a splinter, or a supple bow
whose string is a single hair. A small canoe which a weak old
woman can sew up in a single evening, is found sufficient to carry
two men over a stormy sea in the teeth of a raging hurricane, while
in the quiet of Glooscap’s tent old Noogomich, the grandmother,
chips a piece of beaver bone into the pot when preparing a meal for
visitors, and in a few moments the pot is seen to be full of the finest
moose-meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Micmacs did not worship images. They believed in a
Great Spirit whom they called <span class='it'>Nikskam</span>, which means Father-of-us-all,
and compares with the Norse All-fadir; to him they also gave
the name <span class='it'>Nesulk</span>, meaning Maker, and <span class='it'>Ukchesakumow</span>, the
Great Chief. They seem to have had that mute reverence
for the Great Spirit which kept the children of Israel
from lightly uttering the sacred name “Jehovah,” for we
find no mention anywhere in the Legends of <span class='it'>Nesulk</span> the
Maker or <span class='it'>Nikskam</span> the All-father. They have the name <span class='it'>Mundu</span>
which sounds like “Manitou” of the neighboring tribes, or as
the poet has it: “Gitche Manito the mighty;” but they give the
name to the spirit of evil. Perhaps they borrowed it from enemies,
and naturally supposed that the god of their enemies must be the
devil. Notice in this connection the place called “Main-de-Dieu”
in Cape Breton, which, someone has said, is Mundu or <span class='it'>devil</span> for the
Micmac, and <span class='it'>hand of God</span> for the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We find records of horrible man-eating giants called Kookwesijik;
and another family of enormous beings called Ooskoon
Kookwesijik,—the liver-coloured giants, who return from their
hunting expeditions carrying at their belts a string of caribou as
easily as a Micmac could carry a string of rabbits. These tawny
giants are friendly, as is shown by their dealings with a party of
Micmacs recorded in Legend XVII.; the party had been lost in a
fog for several days in or near St. John harbour, and ever afterwards
held their powerful deliverers in grateful remembrance, although
the Ooskoon Kookwesijik amused themselves for a time at the
expense of the pigmy Ulnoo. We might find entertainment for
hours with the <span class='it'>Megumoowesoo</span>, which is like a fawn or satyr of Greek
mythology; or the <span class='it'>Culloo</span>, an enormous bird, of human intelligence,
and strength sufficient to carry a whole war-party on its back; or
indeed with the dread <span class='it'>Chenoo</span>, or Northman, a sort of were-wolf,
believed to be a transformed lunatic who had been maddened by
disappointment in love, and whose icy heart now finds no pleasure
save when feasting on human flesh and blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the famous warriors are <span class='it'>booowins</span>, or <span class='it'>pow-wows</span>; they have
supernatural powers, and when wide awake and in full presence of
mind cannot be killed except by other braves possessing like powers.
It is remarkable that these braves, or as they say, <span class='it'>kenaps</span>, even
though mortally wounded, would immediately be in perfect health
and strength if by any chance they could succeed in taking the life
of a warrior; it was also believed that while a <span class='it'>kenap</span> was dancing the
magic dance, his body could not be pierced by the swiftest arrow.
A <span class='it'>booowin</span> could assume not only the character but also the form of
whatever animal might be the totem of the clan to which he belonged,
but he was restricted to his own totem, whether fox or wolf, or wild-goose,
or loon, and so when two were fighting, each generally knew
what he might expect of his opponent in the event of defeat in fair
battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last fight between the Kennebecs and the Micmacs occurred
at the mouth of Pictou harbour, and was an instance in which one
hero, or as they say, <span class='it'>kenap</span>, succeeded in destroying, single-handed,
a whole war-party of the enemy. The incident is worthy of mention
in this connection, for the hero of this closing scene of inter-tribal
warfare was a booowin or pow-wow, who might well be compared,
if we consider what he accomplished, with Samson, the strong man
of Israel, or perhaps, even more properly with Heracles and the
other demigods of ancient Grecian story. Our hero’s name is
<span class='it'>Kaktoogo</span>, or Old Thunder, but he also had a second name given by
the French, for the French had arrived on Acadia’s shores before
this final defeat of the invading Kennebecks; the dignified name
was <span class='it'>Toonale</span>, an attempt to pronounce <span class='it'>Tonnere</span>, the French translation
of his sonorous name. You will notice that “r” was replaced
by “l” in all words borrowed from the French and English, for
neither the “r” nor “j” sound was formerly heard in the language
of the Micmacs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us picture two war-parties of the Kennebecs intrenched
within blockhouses from which they make repeated sallies upon the
wary natives of <span class='it'>Megamaage</span><a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>. The forts are constructed by first
digging a cellar, and then felling and arranging great trees, so that
not only a barricade is formed, but a heavily roofed fort. The
Micmacs are intrenched in a somewhat similar manner on their
camping-ground at Merrigomish. It was quite evident to the Micmacs
that their ancestral foes were not on a mere scalping expedition
but had designed a war of extermination. Kaktoogo the Thunderer
must make good use of all his magic, or he and his people will
certainly be destroyed. First and last of the American Red-men,
he took command of a navy; for in order to avoid ambuscades, he
took possession of a French trading ship, and came around by sea
from Merrigomish to Pictou. Soon he bore down upon the hostile
fort with all sails set, and in true Indian fashion, as if his gallant
craft were a bark canoe, ran hard aground as near as possible to his
deadly foe; but before the French timbers quiver from that disastrous
shock; Kaktoogo has leaped into the water, as Cæsar’s
standard-bearer did on the coast of savage Britain a few centuries
ago, and makes his way with all speed toward the land. Kaktoogo
has every faculty alert, and, since he is a mighty pow-wow, no one
but another demigod can kill him outright. He reached the shore
and rushed upon the fort before either friends or foes had recovered
from their astonishment, and,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Like valor’s minion carved out his passage”</p>

<p class='noindent'>as nobly as ever did Macbeth, or Samson, or any other warrior, nor
did he pause till every man of them had paid the forfeit of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So complete was the victory that their ancestral foes never sent
another war-party into <span class='it'>Megamaage</span> the Acadie, or Wholesome Place
of the Micmacs. The bold Kaktoogo had at last “made a realm,”
but it cannot be said of him that he “reigned,” for more insidious
foes than the Kennebecs or the more dreaded Mohawks were among
them, and were gradually conquering them by blandishments that
stole away the manhood of the nation. <span class='it'>Coureurs-du-bois</span> were
roaming everywhere throughout the forest, bringing dangerous
thunder-weapons and more dangerous fire-water; and Glooscap, the
Magnificent One, was grieved as he marked the steady approach of
what the pale-face calls “Civilization.” The daring intruders soon
visited the Son of Heaven at his home on that giant rock, Blomidon,
around whose amethystine base “The tides of Minas swirl;” and
several attempts were made to capture the mighty Sakumow, that he
too might be caged and sent home to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Glooscap was disgusted with the treachery of the foreigners,
and saddened by the weakness of his own people; so, by
way of giving vent to his righteous indignation, he turned his kettle
upside down, and transformed his two dogs into rocks, where they
stand to-day, the guardians of Blomidon, still looking westward
awaiting his return. Then the Great Snowy Owl retreated into the
depths of the forest, where his mournful cry is often heard as he
wails again and again: “Koo-koo-skoe,—I am so sorry.” The
lordly Glooscap sailed away to the land of the setting sun on Fundy’s
ebbing tide as it returned again to the ocean; there he makes his
home in the Acadie of the blessed, until the faithless interlopers
have either changed their barbarian habits, or gone to their own
place. When all men shall have learned to honour Truth he will
return and usher in the millennium amidst the wildest rejoicing of
the elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But oh, the people are weary of waiting for his return, the
stoutest hearts are failing; for search-party after search-party has
come back, bringing only ample proofs of his unceasing love; Glooscap
will never return to beautiful <span class='it'>Megamaage</span> the Acadie, or Wholesome
Place of the Micmacs; Kenap and Sakumow now drown the
memory of the former times by destroying body and soul with the
withering curse of the pale-face, or take up the wail of the old
women and re-echo the mournful cry of the Wobekookoogwes, the
great Snowy Owl, which comes again with startling clearness from
the depth of the forest: “I am so sorry,—Koo-koo-skoo.” And
now as the camp-fire has burned low, and the melancholy cry of the
owl resounds through the lonely archways of the forest, let us repeat
the final word of the <span class='it'>Booske-atookwa</span>, the sage story teller, and reverently
say <span class='it'>Kespeadooksit</span>,—the story is ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have spent a few moments, idly perhaps, in hastily reviewing
some features of the Mythology of the Micmacs, and we have found
a weird delight in studying what was to them most sacred. But the
mythology of the people, beautiful as it is, is not by any means the
life-giving Truth; the outgrowth of the human mind, this rugged
faith must fail to lead that mind to anything outside of itself; for the
most magnificent statue on which man ever worked is still at heart a
stone. Like Tennyson’s Prophet, the Mythology of the Micmacs is
dead:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Dead!</p>
<p class='line'>And the people cried with a stormy cry;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;‘Send them no more for evermore,</p>
<p class='line'>Let the people die.’</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Dead!</p>
<p class='line'>‘Is he then brought so low?’</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And a careless people came from the fields</p>
<p class='line'>With a purse to pay for the show.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is it fair for us to infer that the Christians of the Maritime
Provinces are content to let the Micmacs grope on in their gloom,
ignorantly lifting their hearts in adoration to an unknown God!
Can we be so base as to join the rabble “With a purse to pay for
the show,”—we who have been given the true Mythology and commanded
to carry the news to every creature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Silas T. Rand was a man with the usual desires for
visible results in his missionary work, he restrained these desires,
and laboured to supplement rather than to supplant the work which
had been so faithfully done by the Roman Catholic missionaries.
He labored to present the Gospel message in its fullness as related
to the unobserved duties of everyday life; and to instil into the
minds of the Micmac Christians a clearer understanding of that
perfect love which casts out fear. He did not work for a reward;
he found his reward in his work, and any one may find it too by
speaking of good Mr. Land (Rand) when in conversation with those
for whom he gave his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be fifty years on the twelfth of this present month of
November since Dr. Rand began the work which has incidentally
given us this glimpse of the rich Mythology of the Micmacs. Shall
we not on this jubilee occasion revive in some way the work so
faithfully carried on, and all unite to realize the fullness of the
Gospel message ourselves, as we attempt to give it in its fullness to
every man for whom our Father meant it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Wigwam Scene described in the following pages, occurred
at Hantsport, Nova Scotia, in March, 1855. In the Sixth Annual
Report of the Micmac Mission, in a letter written immediately after
the event, I find it thus inscribed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An event of some interest has just occurred here. One of our
sick Indians, named John Paul, has just died and was buried to-day.
I have taken from my first acquaintance with him, a great
liking to him. I have spent many an hour with him in his wigwam.
He always listened attentively to the Scriptures, and engaged readily
in religious conversation, and I have not been without hope. Efforts
were made to deter him from allowing my visits, but they were
unavailing. I never aimed so much to attack his Romish errors
directly, as to dwell upon the free salvation of the Gospel—without
money and without price. About last New Year’s day, while I was
in Halifax, I was informed that the Romish priest had sent orders
to him to leave Hantsport, and had threatened him with all the
curses of the Church if he remained. His statement to me when I
returned, was: “I won’t leave this place till I choose. It is not in
the power of any man to keep me out of Heaven. That is a matter
between God and my own soul.” He said in Indian: “<span class='it'>Neit
alsoomse</span>.” “I am my own master.” He remained. He continued
to listen to the Bible with attention, and to receive my visits with
kindness and respect till he died. I now recollect that when I came
to read to him, he would send the small children away that we might
not be disturbed. The last time I saw him was a precious season to
my own soul. It seemed easy to speak of the Great Redeemer, and
of the way of Salvation. I may say that special prayer was made
for him in the Meeting House, where a number of Christian friends
were assembled on the day before he died, holding a special prayer-meeting
on our own account. More than one fervent prayer was
offered up for the dying Indian. After the meeting I returned to
my own house, where I met an Indian from John Paul’s wigwam,
who informed me that the poor fellow was very near his end. “But
oh,” said he, “he is wonderfully happy! He says he is going right
to heaven, and that he has already had a glimpse of that bright
happy world. He has been exhorting us all, and telling how easy it
is to be saved. He dreamed last night that he was in heaven.
Heaven seemed to him to be an immense great palace, as large as
this world, all formed of gold. He saw there the glorious Redeemer,
surrounded by an immense host of Saints and Angels, all drest in
white. As he entered he thought they gathered round him and
shouted: John Paul has come! John Paul has come!” The poor
fellow did not die until the following morning, and just before he
died he looked up towards Heaven, and declared that he saw the
angels and the Glory of God. He was astonished that the others
could not see what he saw. He wanted them to hold up his children
that they might see the wonders that he himself saw. He then
sank back on his pillow and quietly expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be seen that the following Poem is not a work of <span class='it'>fiction</span>.
It aims to relate—with some license of imagination, of course, else
it would not be poetry—a plain historical fact. The description of
Paul’s skill and knowledge as a hunter, and in managing their frail
little water-crafts in a sea, is literally true of many of the Indians,
and was true of him. His peace of mind in committing his family
into the hands of God, after he found himself disabled, having burst
a blood-vessel by carrying a large load, from which he never recovered—he
related to me: and this is expressed in the prayer put
into his mouth at the close, “which we did not fully <span class='it'>hear</span> or <span class='it'>share</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be added that after the Poem was written, I read it to
the Indian who gave me the account of John Paul’s death, and as he
spoke the English language well, he had no trouble in understanding
it. And he assured me that it described the scene correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I may add that the <span class='it'>measure</span>—or rather the utter disregard of all
regular measure—was suggested by an old poem I saw somewhere,
describing a very different scene, and the “wildness” of it appeared,
to me to be just suited to a scene of the <span class='it'>Wilderness</span> and the <span class='it'>wigwam</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will not surely be deemed a very great stretch of “poetic
license” to represent oneself as an eye and ear-witness of a scene,
with the surroundings of which he was so familiar, and which had
been so vividly described by those who really were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor need we speculate about the cause of dreams or their significance.
No one will deny that that may be a very exact index of
the state of mind at the time, of the one who dreams. And the
earnest prayer of the writer is, that the reader of these verses, and
himself, may be, at the time of our departure, so full of joy and
peace in believing, that whether waking or dreaming, we may rejoice
with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the
end of our faith, even the salvation of our souls.”</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Sailing in the azure blue.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>And smoothly ride</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On the rolling tide,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In the light and frail canoe;</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Though the thunders roared,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the torrents poured,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the vivid lightnings flew;</p>

<p class='dramaline'>He had toiled away,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In his own humble home,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At basket, bark, and broom,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To gain the scanty fare,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Doled out to him grudgingly, where</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His ancient sires,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Kindled their fires,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And roamed without control,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Over those wide domains,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Rocks, rivers, hills and plains,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In undisputed right, lords of the whole.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But ah! those days were gone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And weeks and months had flown,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Since dire disease had laid him low;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nor huntsman’s skill,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nor workman’s will,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In want, in danger, or alarm,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Could nerve his powerless, palsied arm,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or bend his useless bow.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But God was there,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And fervent prayer,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To Heaven ascended,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And sweetly blended</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With angel’s song,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From Seraph’s tongue;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Joy was there, and Hope, and Faith,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Triumphing over pain and death;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The Light of Truth around him shone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Auspicious of the brighter dawn;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He trusted in the living God,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As washed in Jesu’s precious blood;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>No dread of death or priestly power,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Could shake him in that fearful hour,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nor tyrant’s rod.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The fluttering breath from his palsied lung,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>No utterance gave to his quivering tongue;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But still his ear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was bent to hear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The Words of Truth and Love;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His flashing eye</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Glanced toward the sky,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And he whispered, “I shall die;</p>

<p class='dramaline'>In calm repose,—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Such as the dying Christian only knows.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Consumption’s work was done;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Its racking course was run;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His flesh was wasted, gone;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He seemed but skin and bone,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A breathing skeleton—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Deep silence reigned—no sound,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Save the light fluttering round</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of scattered leaflets, found</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon the frozen ground,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the gently whispering breeze,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Soft sighing through the trees,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was in the wigwam heard;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The voice of man, and beast, and bird,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Were hushed—save the deep drawn sigh,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the feeble wail of the infant’s cry,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Soothed by the mother’s sobbing lullaby,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And bursts of grief from children seated nigh,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Waiting to see their father die.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Kindred and friends were there,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Gathered for prayer,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To soothe the suffering and the grief to share;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Angel Bands were near,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Waiting with joy to bear</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Such as no mortal ear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Could bear, or be allowed to hear.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When suddenly to his wondering eyes,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upstarting to the skies,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A glorious Palace stood;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All formed of burnished gold,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Solid, of massive mould,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The bright Abode</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of the Creator God!</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Where the flaming Seraph sings,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Waving his golden wings;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where the ransomed sinner brings,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Honor and glory to the Eternal Son,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Casting his dazzling crown,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>And clear ringing voice,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In the soft accents of his native tongue,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Suited to the theme,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like that of the Immortal Dreamer’s Dream,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In Bedford’s mystic “Den,” whose fame,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>To the Celestial Throng;—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose dazzling visions of the Throne,</p>

<p class='line0'>On the floor of his wigwam an Indian lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>And his spirit was rapidly passing away;</p>
<p class='line0'>On his brow stood the dewdrop of death, thick and chill,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the life-pulse once bounding was fast growing still;</p>
<p class='line0'>He spoke to his friends as they gathered around,</p>
<p class='line0'>All eager to list to the last fainting sound</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the voice that had cheered them in council or fight.</p>
<p class='line0'>Mid the fires of the wigwam or shadows of night,</p>
<p class='line0'>He told them his prospects, but oh, what were these</p>
<p class='line0'>To guide his frail bark o’er the transparent seas</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose ripple waters no storm surge ere swells,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the far distant land where the “Great Spirit” dwells.</p>
<p class='line0'>Or fearless and free through the hunting grounds roam,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where death as a visitor shall never more come?</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah, no—but the fulness and greenness of grace,</p>
<p class='line0'>The power of Jesus to save their lost race;</p>
<p class='line0'>This, this was the theme—for to him had been given</p>
<p class='line0'>A vision of glory, of God, and of Heaven!</p>
<p class='line0'>He saw the paved streets which like burnished gold shone,</p>
<p class='line0'>And highly exalted sat Christ on His throne;</p>
<p class='line0'>While the angels were circling within their bright home,</p>
<p class='line0'>And shouting triumphantly “John Paul has come!”</p>
<p class='line0'>The Indian fell back on his skin-covered bed,</p>
<p class='line0'>And soon he was one of earth’s numberless dead;</p>

<p class='line0'>Thy mission of love—and though dangers should lurk</p>
<p class='line0'>In each step of thy pathway—yet onward still move</p>
<p class='line0'>Rejoicing to know that thy God doth approve—</p>
<p class='line0'>And oh, if e’er weary or faint by the way,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy footsteps from duty are tempted to stray,</p>
<p class='line0'>Remember one Micmac looks down from above,</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
